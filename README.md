# AI-Powered Financial Sentiment Analysis using FinBERT and XGBoost

This project implements a sentiment analysis system specifically designed for financial text such as news headlines and articles. It combines **FinBERT** — a BERT-based model pre-trained on financial data — with **XGBoost** to improve classification across **Positive**, **Neutral**, and **Negative** categories. The system addresses class imbalance and enhances generalization using **data augmentation** and **SMOTE-based oversampling**.

## Problem Statement

Extracting sentiment from financial text is challenging due to subtle language and **class imbalance** — especially underrepresented classes like **Neutral**. The goal was to build a robust system that could provide accurate and balanced sentiment classification for financial applications.

---

## Experimental Approach

### Baseline Model
- Fine-tuned FinBERT on the original imbalanced dataset
- High precision for Positive class, but lower recall for Neutral and Negative

### Data Balancing & Augmentation
To improve generalization and fairness:
- Applied **SMOTE** to oversample minority classes
- Used **NLP-based augmentation**:
  - Synonym replacement
  - Back-translation (English → French → English)

These steps increased the diversity of input text and reduced the risk of overfitting.

## Final Training Setup
- FinBERT fine-tuned for 5 epochs  
- Optimizer: **AdamW** (learning rate = 3e-6)  
- Loss Function: **Class-weighted cross-entropy**  
- **XGBoost** trained on FinBERT logits for enhanced predictions

---

## Results Overview
- **Accuracy**: 95.62% on test set  
- Improved recall and F1-scores for Neutral and Negative classes  
- Evaluated using:
  - Confusion matrix  
  - Classification report  
  - Precision-recall curves

## Deployment

Deployed using **Gradio** for real-time sentiment prediction.  
- Users can input financial text and instantly receive sentiment output via an intuitive interface (see uploaded screenshots).
