Extracting meaningful sentiment from the vast amount of financial news, articles, and reports has become increasingly important for understanding market dynamics. This project presents a sentiment analysis system designed specifically for financial text. It uses FinBERT, a language model pre-trained on financial data and fine-tuned to classify sentiment into Positive, Neutral, and Negative categories. To enhance prediction accuracy, the sentiment scores generated by FinBERT were used as input to an XGBoost classifier, which helped capture deeper patterns in sentiment signals. One of the main challenges addressed in this project was class imbalance, where certain sentiment classes appeared more frequently than others. To mitigate this, advanced data augmentation techniques were applied, including synonym replacement and back-translation. Additionally, SMOTE was used to synthetically generate new examples for the underrepresented classes. Class weights were manually adjusted during training to further balance the learning process and reduce bias. The final model achieved a classification accuracy of 95.62% and demonstrated strong performance across evaluation metrics such as F1-score, precision-recall curves, and the confusion matrix. The entire system was deployed using a Gradio interface, making it accessible for real-time use. Users can input financial text and instantly receive sentiment feedback. This work shows how transformer-based models, combined with careful data handling and ensemble learning techniques, can build a practical and accurate sentiment analysis tool for financial applications.
